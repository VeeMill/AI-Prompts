PURPOSE:
Convert mapped fields into a production-ready HTML block for external job boards.

OUTPUT MODE (MANDATORY):
• Emit the HTML block ONLY—no explanations, notes, labels, JSON, Markdown, or code fences.
• If any non-HTML text would be produced, delete it.

ALLOWED HTML TAGS ONLY:
• <h4>, <strong>, <em>, <p>, <ul>, <li>, <br>
• Forbidden: <div>, <span>, <table>, <ol>, headers other than <h4>, inline styles, attributes (class, id, style, href, etc.).

SECTION ORDER (EXACT HEADERS & FORMAT):
<h4><strong><em>Job Title:</em></strong></h4>
<p>[Job Title]</p>

<h4><strong><em>Address:</em></strong></h4>
<p>[City, State]</p>

<h4><strong><em>Job Description</em></strong></h4>
<ul>
  <li>[5–7 duty bullets]</li>
</ul>

<h4><strong><em>Critical Information</em></strong></h4>
<ul>
  <li>[Shift/work hours, remote/on-site/hybrid, compliance/submission notes, environment]</li>
</ul>

<h4><strong><em>Education/Licenses Needed</em></strong></h4>
<ul>
  <li>[Credentials, degrees, licenses, certifications]</li>
</ul>

<h4><strong><em>Benefits:</em></strong></h4>
<ul>
  <li>Benefits are available to full-time employees after 90 days of employment.</li>
  <li>A 401(k) with company match is available after 1 year of service.</li>
  <li>This is an AI-formatted job description; recruiter confirmation required.</li>
</ul>

NORMALIZATION RULES (APPLY IN THIS ORDER):
1) Address → keep ONLY “City, ST” (City, State, Zip Code).
2) Delete any pay/bill/compensation/salary content anywhere. Ban tokens (case-insensitive): pay, salary, bill rate, rate, $/hr, $ per hour, per hour, hourly, annual, compensation, $[digits], [digits]/hr, /hr, /hour, k/yr, per year, wage.
2a) Delete any job duration/contract-length content anywhere (e.g., duration, contract length, term, 3-month, 6 month, 12-month, through/until <date>, end date, extension, temp-to-hire timeline). If a sentence primarily conveys duration, remove the sentence entirely.
3) Remove client names/initialisms and job-board artifacts/marketing fluff.
4) Move licensing/certification/degree requirements out of Job Description into Education/Licenses.
5) Route “Schedule/Shift/Hours”, Remote/On-site/Hybrid into Critical Information. Never create a “Schedule” header.
6) Job Description → keep 5–7 concise duty bullets (merge/trim duplicates, keep highest-signal tasks).
7) Drop empty bullets and placeholders: N/A, NA, None, No, -, TBA, TBD.
8) Ensure EXACT headers and casing as specified; bold+italic must wrap the header text inside <h4>.

MISSING DATA POLICY:
• If a <p> section has no valid content → output exactly: <p>Verify with a Recruiter or Staffing Manager!</p>
• If a list section has no valid items → output exactly: <p>Verify with a Recruiter or Staffing Manager!</p>
• Do not include any extra text when applying this rule.

SPACING & VALIDATION:
• Exactly one blank line between sections; no trailing blank lines/spaces.
• Use only allowed tags; ensure well-formed HTML.
• Do not introduce any additional sections, attributes, or text.
